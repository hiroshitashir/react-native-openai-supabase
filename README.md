# react-native-openai-supabase

## Create Your AI Chat Mobile App in 1 day
This repo is a fork from [react-native-openai](https://github.com/candlefinance/react-native-openai). Several changes are made to the original repo below.

- API calls to openai were directly called from react-native app in the original repo, which forced the app to include openai API key and it was unsecure. This forked version calls supabase edge function instead and it forwards api calls to API endpoints at Openai.
- Login logic in UI was changed to call Supabase auth.

The app is only tested on Android Playstore.

## Clone this repo

```$ git clone https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase.git```

## Set up Supabase Edge Function
- Check [supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/quickstart) for setting up edge function at Supabase8
- The definition of the edge function can be found at [packages/rn-openai-lib/supabase/functions/openai](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/tree/main/packages/rn-openai-lib/supabase/functions/openai).
- The edge function above uses Upstash's Redis for rate limiting api calls. Check [Upstash doc](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted) for setting up.
- Under [packages/rn-openai-lib/supabase/functions/openai](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/tree/main/packages/rn-openai-lib/supabase/functions/openai), you have to create .env file and it should contain four environment variables below.
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<Openai's api key>
  UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="<Upstash's redit rest api url>"
  UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="<Upstash token for rest apis>"
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="<service key for supabase>"
  ```
- Inside [packages/rn-openai-lib/lib/supabase.ts](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/blob/main/packages/rn-openai-lib/lib/supabase.ts), specify supabaseUrl and supabaseAnonKey. Check [doc](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/initializing) for details.
  ```
  const supabaseUrl = '<supabase project url>';
  const supabaseAnonKey = '<supabase key>';
  ```

- For configuring which edge function to call from this react native app, specifiy the edge function name inside createChatComplete method in [packages/rn-openai-lib/src/api/index.ts](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/blob/main/packages/rn-openai-lib/src/api/index.ts) below.
  ```
  export async function createChatComplete({
    messages,
    appType,
  }: CreateChatCompleteParams): Promise<CreateChatCompleteResponse> {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke<ChatCompletion>(
      '<your supabase edge function name>',
      {
        body: { query: JSON.stringify(messages), appType: appType },
      }
    );
  ```

## Create App
- App examples can be found at [/apps](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/tree/main/apps).

1. First, create entries in APP_TYPE and configs inside [packages/rn-openai-lib/src/app/config.ts](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/blob/main/packages/rn-openai-lib/src/app/config.ts).
2. Then, copy a directory under [/apps](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/tree/main/apps).
3. In [apps/<app name>/app/index.ts](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/blob/main/apps/comedian/app/index.tsx), pass your APP_TYPE.<your app name> to configureApp.
4. In [apps/<app name>/app.config.js](https://github.com/hiroshitashir/react-native-openai-supabase/blob/main/apps/comedian/app.config.js), adjust string 'ai-your app name-assistant' and 'com.aiassistant.your app name'.
